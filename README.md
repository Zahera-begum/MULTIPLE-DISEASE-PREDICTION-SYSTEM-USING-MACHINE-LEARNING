# MULTIPLE-DISEASE-PREDICTION-SYSTEM-USING-MACHINE-LEARNING
A Machine Learning web app to predict multiple diseases like Diabetes, Heart Disease, and liver using Python 
# Multiple Disease Prediction System

A full-stack, web-based healthcare support application that uses Machine Learning to predict the likelihood of chronic diseases based on user symptoms and medical parameters.

### 🎯 Project Overview

This system is designed to provide early-stage risk assessment for several chronic conditions, reducing the need for immediate physical consultations and helping users in remote areas access healthcare insights.

**Diseases Predicted:**

* 
**Heart Disease** 


* 
**Liver Disease** 


* 
**Diabetes** 



### ✨ Key Features

* 
**Automated Prediction:** Uses trained ML models to analyze clinical data.


* 
**Hospital Recommendations:** Suggests nearby hospitals if a high disease risk is detected.


* 
**Integrated Chatbot:** Provides health-related query support through an interactive bot.


* 
**Admin Dashboard:** Allows administrators to manage hospital data and monitor user feedback.


* 
**Early Detection:** Minimizes human intervention and reduces healthcare costs through quick screening.



### 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Backend:**

* 
**Language:** Python 3.x 


* 
**Framework:** Django & Django REST Framework 


* 
**Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, KNN 


* 
**Database:** SQLite / PostgreSQL 



**Frontend:**

* 
**Library:** React.js 


* 
**Styling:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript 


* 
**API Communication:** Axios 



### ⚙️ How It Works

1. 
**User Input:** Users log in and enter symptoms or clinical data (e.g., medical parameters for Heart or Liver).


2. 
**ML Processing:** The Django backend processes the data using pre-trained models like **Random Forest** or **XGBoost**.


3. 
**Result & Action:** The system displays the risk status and suggests nearby hospitals for further check-ups.
